## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SASS
- BEM
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During the development of this project, I gained a deeper understanding of several web development concepts and technologies, including:

-HTML5: I used HTML5 to structure the content of the profile card component and ensure it was semantically correct and accessible.

-CSS3 and SASS: I used CSS3 and SASS to style the profile card component, including creating custom variables and mixins to ensure consistent styling throughout the component.

-BEM: I used the BEM methodology to organize my CSS classes and make my code more modular and maintainable.

-Flexbox: I used Flexbox to create a responsive layout for the profile card component, ensuring that it looks great on any device, from mobile to desktop.

-Mobile-first approach: I used a mobile-first approach to design and develop the profile card component, starting with the smallest screen size and working my way up to larger screen sizes. This helped ensure that the component was optimized for mobile devices and provided a better user experience across all devices.

Overall, this project was a great opportunity for me to apply my knowledge of HTML5, CSS3, SASS, BEM, and Flexbox to create a responsive, mobile-friendly profile card component.

### Continued development

While the current version of the profile card component is functional, there is still one known issue that needs to be addressed:

Responsive background: The profile card component currently uses two backgrounds that can collide with each other on smaller screens. The component will be updated to ensure that the backgrounds are responsive and don't overlap on any screen size.
